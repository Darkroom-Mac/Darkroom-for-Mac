## 📦 What is Darkroom?

Darkroom for Mac is a premium photo and video editing application built with creative professionals in mind. It delivers powerful editing tools in a beautifully minimal interface optimized for macOS. Whether you're a photographer refining RAW images or a content creator tweaking video color profiles, Darkroom provides a fast, real-time workflow that doesn't compromise on quality.

Unlike traditional editors that require importing/exporting workflows, Darkroom integrates deeply with your Mac photo library, letting you edit images and videos instantly. The app offers non-destructive editing, curve adjustments, selective color, watermarking, and batch processing—all while maintaining lightning-fast performance. 

Darkroom is also optimized for Apple Silicon chips, ensuring smooth performance even on high-resolution RAW files and 4K videos. With support for keyboard shortcuts, LUTs, and cloud sync, it fits naturally into professional workflows and scales with your creative needs.
